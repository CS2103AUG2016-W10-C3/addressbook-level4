## 3. Getting Started
In this section, you will be introduced to the various commands that you will need when using SmartyDo. These commands will be described to you in the format described below.

**Command Format**<br>
Words in `lower case` are the command.<br>
Words in `upper case` are the parameters.<br>
Items in `square brackets` are optional.<br>
The order of parameters is flexible. <br>

### 3.1. **Requesting Help From SmartyDo**

You can use the help command to gain access to this user guide should you need any help with the commands and their format. Should you enter an invalid command (e.g. `abcd`), information will be shown, when possible, to help correct your mistakes. You may also access this function through a keyboard shortcut.<br>

Format: `help`
Keyboard Shortcut: `Ctrl+F1`

**Example:**<br>
If you wish to get help on using SmartyDo, you may enter `help` into the Command Bar.

<img src="images/helpCommand.png" width="500" align="middle"><br>Figure 2. SmartyDo's Help Command<br>

After entering the command, a new window will appear showing you a summary of all commands and keyboard shortcuts.

### 3.5. **Editing Task Details**

You might want to edit details of a task for several reasons. For example, when deadline was extended you will need to update the SmartyDo for this change. Using `edit` command will solve this problem.

Format: `edit INDEX PARAMETER_TYPE NEW_VALUE`

PARAMETER_TYPE the type of the parameter we want to change and NEW_VALUE is the new value for that parameter. <br>
`edit` command edits the task at the specified INDEX. You can easily identify the INDEX of the task by looking at the Visual Box. <br>
If the task you want to edit is not shown in the Visual Box, you can use `view` or `find` command to find the required task. <br>

**Example:**<br>
Let's say you want to add deadline time for task named "Presentation". Then, you must first check the INDEX of that task. In this case, the INDEX of the task is 1. So to add deadline for this task, enter `edit 1 t; DEADLINE`. This will update the deadline of the task. A demonstration of this functionality shown below.

### 3.6. **Deleting Tasks**

Sometimes, you may also want to delete tasks due to unexpected circumstances. To help you to handle such problem, `delete` command can be used. `delete` command is simply deleting task from SmartyDo.

Format: `delete INDEX`

Similar to `edit` command, `delete` command also uses INDEX. INDEX can be found in Visual Box by using `view` command and `find` command.

**Example:**<br>
If you want to delete specfic task, find the INDEX of that task. Let's say the INDEX is 1. Then, enter `delete 1` in the command bar.

<img src="images/adddeleteCommand.png" width="500" align="middle"><br>Figure 7. Example of delete command<br>

After entering `delete` command, SmartyDo will delete the task specified by the INDEX and will show the updated list in the Visual Box. In the screenshot above, you can see that the "Presentation" task has been deleted from SmartyDo.

### 3.7. **Marking Completed Tasks**

Instead of deleting the task, you may want to mark the task as complete and store the details of the task in the SmartyDo. In this case, you can use `done` command. By using `done` command, you can easily identify the completed tasks from the list.

Format: `done INDEX`

Similar to `delete` command and `edit` command, INDEX is used in `done` command.

**Example:**<br>
You have now completed the task named "Presentation" and now you want to mark this task as complete. To do this, you will need to check the INDEX of this task. In this case, INDEX of this task is 1. So, entering `done 1` will mark "User Guide" task as complete.

<img src="images/doneCommand.png" width="250" align="middle"><br>Figure 8. Example of done command<br>

After entering the `done` command, you are now able to identify the completed task easily from the list.
