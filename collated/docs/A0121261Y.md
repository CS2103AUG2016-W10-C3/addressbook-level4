### 3.8. **Undoing and Redoing**

With `undo`, you are allowed to reverse your previous changes sequentially while `redo` allows you to reverse the change done by `undo`.<br>

- `undo` command requires the application to have executed atleast one undoable command after launching.
- `redo` command requires the application to have executed atleast one succussful `undo` command after launching.

Undoable Commands:`add`, `delete`, `edit`, `done`

> SmartyDo **does not store** history of actions in your computer.
> Your history of actions resets when SmartyDo is launched.
> Also, if you enter any undoable command after entering `redo` or `undo`, your history of actions would be _**removed**_. <br>

Format: `undo`, `redo`

**Example:**<br>
Let's say you have added a task and your friend told you that your tutor has changed the date. You would like to undo it. You can undo it as long as you just added it, as shown below.

By entering `undo` command, SmartyDo updates your list of tasks to how it was before you executed an undoable action. From the screenshot above, you can see that the date of the task named "Presentation" had changed.

However, you realized that your friend was wrong and you want to change the date back again. In this case, you do not need to use edit command again. Instead you can simply use `redo` command, as shown below.

<img src="images/undoredoCommand.png" width="500" align="middle"><br>Figure 9.2. Before(left) and after(right) of an undo command<br>

By using `redo` command, SmartyDo updates your list of tasks to how it was before you executed `undo` command. From the screenshot above, you can see that the "Presentation" task has been restored to its previous state.
